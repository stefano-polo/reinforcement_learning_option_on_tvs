Using this approximation combined with a new analytical pricing formula for an approximating geometric mean-based option as a control variate, excellent performance for Monte Carlo pricing in a control variate setting is obtained."

It also follows that a well-outlined dynamic TVS can achieve a higher Sharpe ratio than the static maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio.},

The next part describes techniques for improving simulation accuracy and efficiency. The final third of the book addresses special topics: estimating price sensitivities, valuing American options, and measuring market risk and credit risk in financial portfolios." "The most important prerequisite is familiarity with the mathematical tools used to specify and analyze continuous time models in finance, in particular the key ideas of stochastic calculus. Prior exposure to the basic principles of option pricing is useful but not essential."

Concentrating on the probabilistic theory of continuous arbitrage pricing of financial derivatives, including stochastic optimal control theory and Merton's fund separation theory, the book is designed for graduate students and combines necessary mathematical background with a solid economic focus. It includes a solved example for every new technique presented, contains numerous exercises, and suggests further reading in each chapter. In this substantially extended new edition Bjork has added separate and complete chapters on the martingale approach to optimal investment problems, optimal stopping theory with applications to American options, and positive interest models and their connection to potential theory and stochastic discount factors. More advanced areas of study are clearly marked to help students and teachers use the book as it suits their needs.},

We give the explicit form for a class of adaptive policies that possess optimal increase rate properties for the total expected finite horizon reward, under sufficient assumptions of finite state-action spaces and irreducibility of the transition law. A main feature of the proposed policies is that the choice of actions, at each state and time period, is based on indices that are inflations of the right-hand side of the estimated average reward optimality equations.},

Although gradient methods cannot make large changes in the values of the parameters, we show that the natural gradient is moving toward choosing a greedy optimal action rather than just a better action. These greedy optimal actions are those that would be chosen under one improvement step of policy iteration with approximate, compatible value functions, as defined by Sutton et al. [9]. We then show drastic performance improvements in simple MDPs and in the more challenging MDP of Tetris.},

publisher = {Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics},

edition = {2nd},
abstract = {From the Publisher:What is the most accurate way to sum floating point numbers__ __ What are the advantages of IEEE arithmetic__ __ How accurate is Gaussian elimination and what were the key breakthroughs in the development of error analysis for the method__ __ The answers to these and many related questions are included here.  This book gives a thorough, up-to-date treatment of the behavior of numerical algorithms in finite precision arithmetic. It combines algorithmic derivations, perturbation theory, and rounding error analysis. Software practicalities are emphasized throughout, with particular reference to LAPACK and MATLAB. The best available error bounds, some of them new, are presented in a unified format with a minimum of jargon. Because of its central role in revealing problem sensitivity and providing error bounds, perturbation theory is treated in detail. Historical perspective and insight are given, with particular reference to the fundamental work of Wilkinson and Turing, and the many quotations provide further information in an accessible format.  The book is unique in that algorithmic developments and motivations are given succinctly and implementation details minimized, so that attention can be concentrated on accuracy and stability results. Here, in one place and in a unified notation, is error analysis for most of the standard algorithms in matrix computations. Not since Wilkinson's Rounding Errors in Algebraic Processes (1963) and The Algebraic Eigenvalue Problem (1965) has any volume treated this subject in such depth. A number of topics are treated that are not usually covered in numerical analysis textbooks, including floating point summation, block LU factorization, condition number estimation, the Sylvester equation, powers of matrices, finite precision behavior of stationary iterative methods, Vandermonde systems, and fast matrix multiplication. Although not designed specifically as a textbook, this volume is a suitable reference for an advanced course, and could be used by instructors at all levels as a supplementary text from which to draw examples, historical perspective, statements of results, and exercises (many of which have never before appeared in textbooks). The book is designed to be a comprehensive reference and its bibliography contains more than 1100 references from the research literature. Audience  Specialists in numerical analysis as well as computational scientists and engineers concerned about the accuracy of their results will benefit from this book. Much of the book can be understood with only a basic grounding in numerical analysis and linear algebra. About the Author  Nicholas J. Higham is a Professor of Applied Mathematics at the University of Manchester, England. He is the author of more than 40 publications and is a member of the editorial boards of the SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications and the IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis. His book Handbook of Writing for the Mathematical Sciences was published by SIAM in 1993.}

abstract = {We present a stochastic local volatility model for derivative contracts on commodity futures able to describe forward curve and smile dynamics with a fast calibration to liquid market quotes. A parsimonious parametrization is introduced to deal with the limited number of options quoted in the market. Cleared commodity markets for futures and options are analyzed to include in the pricing framework-specific trading clauses and margining procedures. Numerical examples for calibration and pricing are provided for different commodity products.},

abstract = {We show how to use "complementary priors" to eliminate the explaining-away effects that make inference difficult in densely connected belief nets that have many hidden layers. Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind.},

abstract="Melanoma is the most deathly of all skin cancers but early diagnosis can ensure a high degree of survival. Early diagnosis is one of the greatest challenges due to lack of experience of general practitioners (GPs). In this paper we present a clinical decision support system designed for general practitioners, aimed at saving time and resources in the diagnostic process. Segmentation, pattern recognition, and change detection are the important steps in our approach. This paper also investigates the performance of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) learning algorithms for skin cancer diagnosis. The capabilities of three learning algorithms i.e. Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), Resilient Back propagation (RP), Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG) algorithms in differentiating melanoma and benign lesions are studied and their performances are compared. The results show that Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was quick and efficient in figuring out benign lesions with specificity 95.1{\%}, while SCG algorithm gave better results in detecting melanoma at the cost of more number of epochs with sensitivity 92.6{\%}.",

abstract = "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) receive an important interest from Artificial Intelligence researches (AI) this last decade due to their high capability to learn complex internal structures to expose relevant information. However, RNNs fail to reveal long-term dependencies and new RNN with gates have been proposed to address this drawback such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). This RNN-based model requires 4 gates to learn both short and long-term dependencies for a given sequence of basic elements. Recently, a new family of RNN called “Gated Recurrent Unit” has been introduced. The GRU contains few gates (reset and update gates) but is based on gates grouping without taking into account the latent relations between short and long-term dependencies. The GRU term dependencies management through hidden units is therefore similar for all hidden neurons. Moreover, the learning of gated RNNs requires a large amount of data and, despite the advent of GPU cards that allow the model to be learned quicker, the processing time is quite costly. This paper proposes a new RNN called “Parsimonious Memory Unit” (PMU) based on the strong assumption that short and long-term dependencies are related and that the role of each hidden neuron has to be different to better handle term dependencies. Experiments conduced on both a small (short-term) spoken dialogues data set from the DECODA project, a large (long-term) textual document corpus from the 20-Newsgroups and a language modeling task, show that the proposed PMU-RNN reaches similar, even better performances (efficiency) with less processing time (improve portability) with a gain of 50%. Moreover, the experiments on the gates’ activity show that the proposed PMU manages better term dependencies than the GRU-RNN model."
